      <p>The Basil Skyers Myeloma Foundation wants you to help promote awareness about multiple myeloma, the second most common
        yet little known blood cancer disease. The Foundation is partnering with Liv AWOL Junior/Under 23 Women’s Race Cycling
        Team, and Cycles UK. In support of us, we would like you to donate your cycling, running, walking and swimming miles!
        That is all we need you to do!</p>
      <h3>What is multiple myeloma?</h3>
      <p>Multiple myeloma, often called ‘myeloma’ is an incurable cancer of the blood plasma. There are 4,800 new cases diagnosed
        in the UK each year and the first family, friends or colleagues hear the words myeloma, is often, at the point of
        diagnosis. Multiple myeloma attacks the blood plasma cells. The blood plasma cells normally produce antibodies that
        help to fight infection but in the case of myeloma, they start to proliferate and produce rogue proteins that have
        no use or function. The proliferation of the cancerous cells in the blood plasma displaces healthy red and white
        cells from the bone marrow causing anaemia and fatigue, frequent infections, and unexplained bruising and bleeding.
        These symptoms are also often accompanied by bone pain particularly in the lower back and the ribs, and sometimes
        the long bones.</p>
      <p>Myeloma can affect anyone, both men and women. However, the incidence of myeloma is higher in older people, and in
        particular older men. For some reason also, black African and black Caribbean people have a higher risk than the
        population generally and they are diagnosed at a younger age. While myeloma is incurable, there are many treatments
        that can halt the progress of the disease for ten years or more, and new treatments are continually being developed.</p>
      <p>Please help us to raise awareness by donating your cycling, running, walking and swimming miles!</p>
